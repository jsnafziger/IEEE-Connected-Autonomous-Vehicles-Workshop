Perception Systems for Self-Driving Cars

## Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars

We will motivate the problem and the challenges of vehicle environment perception by drawing intuition and reverse engineering existing self-driving car systems. A function system architecture will be discussed to help understand and decompose the complex system while highlighting relationships and to vehicle communications (V2X) technologies. Focus will be on real-time computer vision methods applied to the lane estimation use-case. We will explore, in detail, both classical computer vision methods and more recent deep learning approaches to lane estimation. The perception problem will be extended to scene understanding and behavior prediction by reviewing the dynamic object recognition problem and the components associated with the real-time tracking of environmental objects.
